We first separate the feature vectors and class labels separately.
We convert the continous feature vectors into categorical values. Eg: Hours per week is split into Low, Medium and High.
After conversion we use pandas get_dummies function to convert all the categorical feature vectors into binary feature vectors.
There are 96 features.

Comparison of Online Learning curves for Perceptron and Passive Aggressive
Perceptron at its 1st iteration has 7600 mistakes, 2nd iteration 6700 mistakes and so on. Passive Aggressive at its 1st iteration has 7700 mistakes, 2nd iteration 7000 mistakes and so on. Therefore Perceptron Algorithm learns faster when compared to Passive aggressive for few iterations.

Comparison of Accuracy Curves for Perceptron and Passive Aggressive
The accuracy curve for training data of perceptron is higher compared to that of passive aggressive for every iteration. But for development and test data passive aggressive has an increase in the accuracy for every iteration. But for perceptron there is an increase in the accuracies and a sharp drop in accuracy when number of iterations increases.

2018-10-28 20:57:58.196334	Plotting general learning curve for Passive Aggressive

Comparison of General Learning Curve for Perceptron and Passive Aggressive
The general learning curve for train of both Perceptron and Passive Aggressive does not change by much when number of examples are increased for every iteration. In perceptron for development and testing data when the number of examples increases initially there is a rise and then drop in accuracy but for passive aggressive initially there is a drop in accuracy when number of iterations increase but afterwards there is a steady increase.

Observing Perceptron when training examples are shuffled
The learning rate is reduced by 0.1 for every iteration. The online learning curve has almost the same number of mistakes for iteration 4 and 5 (almost converge). But the accuracy curve has increased for every iteration without any drop in accuracy when iterations increases. The accuracy has also increased when compared to standard perceptron.
